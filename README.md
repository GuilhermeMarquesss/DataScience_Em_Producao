# Context

The Rossmann drugstore chain stores need to be renovated and the CEO needs to decide how much to dedicate to restoring each one. The chief financial officer (CFO) required forecasting models for the analytics team to support their decision on how much budget at each store needs to be allocated.

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
